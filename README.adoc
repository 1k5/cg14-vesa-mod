The CG14 / SX is the onboard framebuffer in the SPARCstation 20 and the (rare)
SPARCstation 10SX.  The goal of this project is to modify the CG14 FCode and
add additional video modes, in particular modes suitable for use with modern
LCD displays.

This repository contains images of the SPARCstation 20 PROM v2.25 and v2.25r
and the extracted CG14 FCode, which turns out to be identical in both cases.
The current state of the project is as follows:


The OpenBoot PROM
-----------------
Here is an overview of the relevant parts of the OBP v2.25 and v2.25r PROMs.
As mentioned above, the CG14 FCode in both is identical.

The CG14 FCode
--------------
The file `ss20-cg14.fcode` contains the CG14 FCode extracted from the PROM.  I
detokenized the FCode using combination of both SUNs detokenizer and _der
Mouse_'s.  The resulting file `ss20-cg14.fth` when tokenized using SUNs
tokenizer reproduces the binary FCode exactly.

The next step is to modify the Forth code and add additional video modes.  This
is still a work in progress, so stay tuned.


The Logos
---------
The CG14 comes with 3 built-in logos:
